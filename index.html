            <h2>My first sight</h2>
            <img class="polaroid" src="images/image1.jpg"/>
            <p>Seeing someone so happy mixed up with the nervousness and new expectations with confidence in your smile and spark in your eyes. You were the highlight of that day, everything seemed perfect with your presence there</p>

            <h2>Our first meeting</h2>
            <img class="polaroid" src="images/image2.gif"/>
            <p>I wish I had photos, or maybe videos of this time. I saw a very very hardworking girl trying to make it on her own, having so many doubts and challenges but facing them with her cute smile and her taste for good food :)</p>

              <h2>The first time we worked together</h2>
              <img class="polaroid" src="images/image3.gif"/>
              <p>I didn't saw you that day but in my eyes I saw a girl who is just very very tired and just want work to end, this was very different from our first meeting. So here you unlocked a hidden superpower in me, I have never taught anyone in my life, 
                and I think you are the first and the last one. I think I could have atleast put your mind to rest and here I have image of you sleeping peacefully finally.

              <img class="polaroid" src="images/image4.jpg"/>
              <p>After that we have met many many times and everytime there has been something special. Your presence is enough to make the moment special, you can outshine anyone. A camera can only capture the reflections from the light, but the light
                you emit can even make the camera blind.

            My bad memories are getting replaced by good experiences with you, you are beautiful from inside and outside. Always be you, you are perfect.
